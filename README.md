# pyGAMESS-DS
# This script is intended to automate retrieval of main informations from GAMESS-US. These are:

- Coordinates found via geometry optimization (in case it exists).
- Total free energy in solvent.
- Total interaction (DELTA + ES + CAV + DISP + REP).
- Values of Gibbs energy corrections.
- First vibrational frequency.
- Net charges.

# Installing (Windows):

- Put the executable in a folder with all the files generated by GAMESS-US (ps: they should always be found in pairs, i.e.: E1.out, G1.out, E2.out, G2.out, etc).
- Execute as admin.
- In the end, a log file is generated in C:/LOG_pyGAMESS-DataScan.txt
